# CodeSwiftly-Edition-3

This repository represents the final version of CodeSwiftly, an educational app developed for my STEM Fair project.

### Purpose of this project:

As a passionate student in the field of computer science, I initiated the development of CodeSwiftly with a primary goal of addressing the challenges faced by girls in my grade who often struggle and feel inadequate in STEM subjects. Historically, women have been underrepresented in STEM industries, and this gender disparity has persisted over time.

The motivation for this project stems from a stark statistic highlighted in the 2022 Stack Overflow survey, the world's largest developer community. The survey revealed that male developers constituted 91.88%, whereas female developers accounted for only 5.17%. This data underscored the existence of gender discrimination within tech communities, emphasizing the urgent need for interventions to promote inclusivity.

Living in a world where technology plays an indispensable role in our lives, STEM-related fields significantly influence our society. Recognizing the importance of education equity and gender equality, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals has prioritized these aspects to ensure equal access for females in STEM fields and underscore the significance of their representation.

### Project Features:

- **Optimistic Approach to Programming:** CodeSwiftly-Edition-3 is designed to provide a positive and encouraging environment for participants, specifically targeting four female and four male 9th graders. The app aims to foster an optimistic outlook towards programming, encouraging all students to explore equal opportunities in both male and female-dominated STEM fields.

- **Equal Access to Education:** The project's core objective is to promote equal access to education and professional opportunities in STEM fields, irrespective of gender. By creating a coding app tailored for participants at an early educational stage, CodeSwiftly-Edition-3 seeks to contribute to building a more inclusive and diverse STEM community.

- **Open Field for Everyone:** The app envisions constructing an open field where all individuals, regardless of gender, can make equal contributions and explore possibilities in STEM-related disciplines. By addressing gender disparities early in education, CodeSwiftly-Edition-3 aims to pave the way for a more equitable and diverse future in technology.
